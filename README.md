# State and national POTUS polling model

Code for a dynamic multi-level Bayesian model to predict US presidential elections, implemented in Stan.

Improving on Kremp/Gelman's implementation of Linzer's dynamic linear model.


## TODO:

- [ ] rewrite model with correlation matrix
- [ ] add 3rd party step 
- [ ] add correction for partisan survey composition
- [ ] find a better prior (approval/favorability lm)


## Model design
